We began decades ago to query the anti-democratic absurdities of the European Union Thanks to the referendum we find a door has magically opened 
We can see the sunlit meadows beyond 
It is not we who have changed It is the European Union that has changed out of all recognition and it is still becoming ever more centralizing interfering and anti-democratic
The independence of this country is being seriously compromised It is this fundamental democratic problem this erosion of democracy that brings me into this fight
There is simply no common political culture in Europe no common media no common sense of humor and no awareness of each others politics so that the European Union as a whole has no common sense of things you need for a democracy to work efficiently You need trust and you need shame There is no trust partly for the obvious reason that people often fail to understand each others languages There is no shame because it is not clear who you are letting down if you abuse the European Union system
Do we feel loyalty to the twelve star flag Do our hearts pitter-patter as we watch it flutter over public buildings On the contrary The British share with other European Union populations a growing sense of alienation which is one of the reasons turn-out at European elections continues to decline
Whenever there is a crisis of any kind the cry is always the same More Europe more Europe
What did they do when the Berlin wall came down and the French panicked about German unification More Europe 
What are they saying now when the ensuing single currency has become a disaster More Europe
They persist in the delusion that political cohesion can be created by a forcible economic integration and they are achieving exactly the opposite Do the Greeks feel warmer towards the Germans Do they feel a community of interest Of course not
The answer to the problems of Europe today is not more Europe if that means more forcible economic and political integration The answer is reform and devolution of powers back to nations and people and a return to intergovernmentalism at least for this country and that means Vote Leave on June twenty-third
And of course there will be some in this country who are rightly troubled by a sense of neighbourly duty But they feel uneasy about pulling out of the European Union in its hour of need if Britain leaves the European Union there will be a return to slaughter on Flanders Fields
This grossly underestimates the Nato guarantee that has underpinned peace
It understates the sense in which it is the European Union and its anti-democratic tendencies that are now a force for instability and alienation
The truth is it is Brexit that is now the great project of European liberalism and I am afraid that it is the European Union for all the high ideals with which it began that now represents the ancien regime
It is we who are speaking up for the people and it is they who are defending an obscurantist and universalist system of government that is now well past its sell by date and which is ever more remote from ordinary voters
It is we in the Leave Camp not they who stand in the tradition of the liberal cosmopolitan European enlightenment
It is a choice between getting dragged ever further into a federal superstate or taking a stand now
