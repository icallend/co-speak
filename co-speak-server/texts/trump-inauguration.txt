For many of our citizens a different reality exists mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential
This American carnage stops right here and stops right now
For many decades we have enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military we have defended other nations borders while refusing to defend our own
And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay we have made other countries rich while the wealth strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon
One by one the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world
But that is the past And now we are looking only to the future
We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city in every foreign capital and in every hall of power From this day forward a new vision will govern our land From this day forward it is going to be only America first America first
Every decision on trade on taxes on immigration on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products stealing our companies and destroying our jobs
Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down
America will start winning again winning like never before
We will bring back our jobs We will bring back our borders We will bring back our wealth And we will bring back our dreams
